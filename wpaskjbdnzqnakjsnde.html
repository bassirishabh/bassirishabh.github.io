	   			Part 1. Search Engine Optimization (20 points)
          In this part, your goal is to put on your "search engine optimization" hat. Your job is to create a webpage that scores highest for the query wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde. As of today (March 23) there are no hits for this query on Google. Based on our discussions of search engine ranking algorithms, you know that several factors may impact a page's rank. Your goal is to use this knowledge to promote your own page to the top of the list.

          What we're doing here is a form of SEO contest. While you have great latitude in how you approach this problem, you are not allowed to engage in any unethical or illegal behavior. Please read the discussion of "white hat" versus "black hat" SEO over at Wikipedia.

          The only requirement is that somewhere in the page (possibly in the html) you must include your name or some other way for us to identify you (e.g., your gmail username).

          Rules of the game:

          Your target page may only be a TAMU student page, a page on your own webserver, a page on a standard platform (e.g., GitHub Pages), or some other primarily user-controlled page.
          Your target page MAY NOT be a twitter account, a facebook page, a LinkedIn profile, or similar page.
          No wikipedia vandalism.
          No comment spamming of blogs or news sites.
          If you have concerns/questions/clarifications,please post a message to the slack and we will discuss.
          On April 16 (the homework due date), we will examine the rankings on Google only for the query wpaskjbdn zqnakjsnde. We will assign points as follows:

          12 points for your explanation of your approach and a link to your target page.
          5 points for creativity in your approach. Basically, did you try some interesting strategy? Did you put some thought into your approach?
          1 points for placing your page in the results returned by Google.
          1 point for placing your page in the top-50 results contributed by students in this class on Google.
          1 point for placing your page in the top-10 results contributed by students in this class on Google.
          1 bonus point, a vigorous announcement in class, and a high-five for having the top result.
          We encourage you to get started early on this part, so there is time for Google to discover your pages and integrate them into their search results.

          As an added bonus, we will revisit the rankings at the end of the semester (sometime in May) and award bonus points to your final exam. Details to follow.
